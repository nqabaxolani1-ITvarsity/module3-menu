                <p><b>"The recipe calls for a beef tenderloin roast, which is the most tende (and most expensive) cut of beef available. 
                    “Beef tenderloin” refers to the large cut of beef before it is sliced into steaks. Once cut, those steaks are referred to as filet mignon. 
                    Package labeling can vary depending upon where you shop — for example, you will sometimes find it labeled Chateaubriand or filet mignon roast —
                     so if you’re uncertain about what you’re buying, just ask the butcher.
                    You  may notice that my tenderloin has some kitchen twine tied around one end of it; that is the way I purchased it. Butchers often tie tenderloin
                     up near the tapered end so that it is the same thickness all the way around.
                    If yours comes that way, leave the string on until after it’s cooked.  If it doesn’t, no worries – no need to do any tying.
